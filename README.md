### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `todoDB`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` in your terminal
5. Open up (http://localhost:5000/) in your browser.

## Usage
This application was built to help orginize your tasks. When you add your task you will see it populate below. Once you have completed the task hitting the 'complete task' button will check off your task. If you accidently 'complete' the wrong task hitting restart task will change the task back to uncomplete. I made this an option for tasks you know you will repeat. The 'Delete Task' button will remove the task completely.



## Acknowledgement
